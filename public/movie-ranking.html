<h1>The Best Movies According to Marius</h1>
    
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

        <hr />

        <h3>Spiderman 3</h3>
            <p>From all the orignal Spiderman movies, one through to three, this one was my favourite.</p>
        <h3>Iron Man</h3>
            <p>Iron Man, although being an old movie, was peek entertainment in my childhood. I probably watched this movie 100 times.</p>
        <h3>Extraction</h3>
            <p>A much more recent movie, but amazing all the same. I rate both number 1 and 2 as a must watch!</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <h2>Honorable mentions.</h2>

        <hr />

        <h3>The Equalizer</h3>
            <p>An amazing action movie set, The Equalizer 1 and 2 are heartwarming action movies about a retired CIA agent, anonomously helping regular people against evil gangs and corrupted officials.</p>
        <h3>Django</h3>
            <p>Man... I don't know what to say. This movie brought tears to my eyes. This movie reminds us about the brutal nature of slavery and how the character Django get's a taste of freedom. All the freedom he needed in order to fight for said freedom and rescue his wife broomhilda from a brutal slaver.</p>
